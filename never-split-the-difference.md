# Never Split the Difference

## Chris Voss

### Ackerman bargaining
- Set your target price as a nonround number
- Offer 65, 85, 95, 100 percent
- Use empathy in between offers
- On your final offer, throw in a non-monetary item

```
target = $552,500

65%    = 359,125
85%    = 469,625
95%    = 524,875
100%   = 552,500
```
